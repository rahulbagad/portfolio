👋 Hi There, this is my upcoming personal website. This is work in progress 🚧. 


Key features:
  - Minimal
  - Light & Dark theme
  - Content is loaded dynamically from JSON data

Please free to fork and make changes. You can use this as a template. You just need to update `gatsby-config.js` metadata.

Feedback is welcome 😁
